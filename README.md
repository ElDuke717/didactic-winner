This is a repo of fun financial experiments with Python and AI. It's a place to explore and learn about financial data, machine learning, and more.

It came from a dialog with my friend who is designing different finance workflows and learning more about Apple Shortcuts. I thought it would be fun to explore some of these ideas in Python and share them with you.
